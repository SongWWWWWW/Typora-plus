# Development Log

## 2026-06-06 - P0/P1 Foundation

Completed:

- Created npm workspace monorepo.
- Added strict TypeScript project references.
- Implemented base lifecycle, event, URI helpers.
- Implemented platform service collection, command service, configuration service, workspace service, browser-backed text-file service.
- Implemented Markdown outline extraction and document stats with code-fence awareness.
- Added centralized theme tokens.
- Implemented CodeMirror 6 Markdown editor with live-preview-oriented styling.
- Implemented Workbench layout, activity bar, sidebar, outline, current-note search, command palette, statusbar, focus mode, typewriter mode, theme toggle.
- Added Electron main/preload skeleton with context isolation, sandbox, and disabled Node integration.
- Centralized Electron shell defaults in `apps/desktop/electron/shellConfig.ts`.
- Added build code splitting for editor/runtime dependencies.
- Added unit tests for base, platform, markdown, and editor behavior.

Quality gate:

- `npm run typecheck`: passed
- `npm test`: passed, 11 tests
- `npm run build`: passed
- `npm audit --audit-level=moderate`: passed with 0 vulnerabilities
- Browser verification: passed at `http://127.0.0.1:5173`
- Desktop viewport check: passed with stable editor/sidebar/titlebar/statusbar layout
- Mobile viewport check: passed without horizontal overflow

Review:

- No user content is stored in app-only proprietary structures; browser draft persistence is temporary for P1.
- Configuration defaults live in `packages/platform/src/configuration.ts`.
- Visual values live in `packages/theme/src/tokens.css` or editor theme configuration.
- Workbench consumes services instead of directly owning persistence.
- Editor does not depend on Workbench or Electron.
- Source directories were checked after build; generated artifacts remain in `dist` outputs.

Known limitations:

- Native filesystem service is not implemented yet.
- SQLite indexing is not implemented yet.
- Markdown live preview currently styles lines; inactive marker hiding and rich block widgets are planned.
- Extension host is architectural direction only at this stage.

Next stage:

- P2: native file workspace, file tree, quick open, real save/open flow, attachment/image paste service.
